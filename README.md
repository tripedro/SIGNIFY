# SIGNIFY: Sign Language Guide &amp; Interactive Framework

## Overview
This web-based ASL (American Sign Language) learning tool is designed to help users learn ASL efficiently and engagingly.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have installed the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). This project uses `npm` (Node package manager) to manage dependencies.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://your-repository-url.git
cd your-repository-name
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies by running:
```bash
npm install
```
This command reads the package.json file and installs the required local dependencies necessary for the project.

### Step 3: Start the Development Server

Start the development server with Parcel:
```bash
npm run start
```
This command compiles the application and serves it on a local web server. By default, the server runs at http://localhost:1234 unless otherwise configured.

### Step 4: Open the Application
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:1234 to view the application. Ensure your webcam is enabled and permitted to be used by the browser to see the hand pose detection.
